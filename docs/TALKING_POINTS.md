# TALKING_POINTS — HireStream

Decisions, trade-offs, and likely interview questions, by phase. T0.5 fills in the full skeleton;
T6.3 finalises it.

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap

### Pinning local Spark to the EMR release (ADR-0002)
- **Decision:** `emr-spark-8.1.0` (Spark 4.1.1, JDK 17, Python 3.11, ARM64). Local `pyspark==4.1.1`
  pinned exactly. `hirestream.versions` holds the pins; `tests/unit/test_versions.py` fails on drift.
- **Rejected:** the spec's `emr-spark-8.0.0`. It had the same runtimes, but an older Spark and
  shorter support, and it was written before 8.1.0 (LTS, supported to 2029) existed. Also rejected:
  `emr-7.14.0`, because Spark 3.5 has ANSI mode off by default, which would be a silent semantic
  difference.
- **Q: "Why pin pyspark exactly instead of `>=4.1`?"** A: Local runs are how I prove correctness
  before paying for EMR. A different minor version can change query plans, defaults such as ANSI
  mode and timestamp parsing, and Parquet writer behaviour. Then a green local run proves nothing
  about the cloud. The exact pin plus a test makes version drift a CI failure instead of a
  surprise in production.

### Naming parity gaps instead of claiming parity (ADR-0003)
- **Decision:** one code path. Twelve named gaps (Spark build, S3A vs POSIX, Firehose vs FileSink,
  Postgres vs Redshift, quota, …), each with its containment and the test that covers it.
- **Q: "How do you know your local pipeline behaves like production?"** A: I don't assume it. I
  list every difference and design around the dangerous ones. For example, nothing relies on
  rename-as-commit, because S3 has no atomic rename. Silver reads from a manifest instead of
  trusting that an hour prefix is complete, because Firehose delivers late. Correctness is checked
  on outputs (DQ and ground truth), which are engine-independent. What can't be tested locally
  goes on the cloud-demo checklist.
